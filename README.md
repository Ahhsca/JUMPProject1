Prompt:
You need to create an Employee Management System for a company. This EMS should be able to add new Employees, update Employee information,remove Employees,and list Employee information. The user interface (U/I) will be the Java console, where you can print the program information, and take in inputs from the userâ€™s standard input (thekeyboard). You will need to have a basic menu with options to navigate your application for your users to interact with.

# Requirements:
* Use the principles of OOP in your design. I.e. encapsulate relevant code together. Break down methods and classes with separation of concerns (not everything in one big main method), so that each part of your code is focused on doing one task, and doing it well
* Employee should store the following at minimum: firstname, last name,employee id (needs to be unique), Date of Employment, salary, and department as a String (Bonus below for Departmentas its own class)
* Implement the use of at least one custom exception
* Implement at least one Java stream
* Use Exception handling in all appropriate places
* Have a console based U/I menu system that allows a user to navigate through your app and perform all of the CRUD operations listed above, at a minimum


# Areas for improvement: 
  * Make department an object
  * Use DateTime API for Date of Employment


# Issues
  * Currently string inputs only takes a single word
  * ID is not unique if Employee is added at different run times
